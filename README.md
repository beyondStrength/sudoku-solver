# sudoku-solver
Implementation of backtracking algorithm in C to solve a Sudoku puzzle. I'm choosing to follow all guidelines from 42, since i've done the basecamp I feel a little empty and decided to make this projects, which was something that I was really into in the past. That's it, i hope it works hehehe
